-> Service is an android component used to perform long running tasks in background or foreground independent of UI.

//types
-> Normal Service
    -> Used to perform operations in foreground
    -> Always runs on main thread.
    -> Needs you to manage threading and stopping.
    -> context.startService() and context.stopService()/stopSelf()
-> Bound Service
    -> Similar to normal service but here the service is bound to a lifecycle aware component(s).
    -> The lifecycle is determined by the owner(s) in which it is tied to.
-> IntentService
    -> Used to perform operations in background.
    -> Runs on a background worker thread.
    -> Deprecated now
-> JobIntentService
    -> Similar to IntentService but for Android O and below.
    -> Schedules work with the JobScheduler on newer devices and still runs as a service on older ones.
-> LifecycleService
    -> Normal service but with a lifecycle owner.
    -> Helps to provide a lifecycleScope to launch coroutines inside instead of GlobalScope.
