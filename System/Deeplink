-> Deeplink is the process of making internal hyperlinks that can open the app directly to a specific page and powering its info in the same link.
-> This is used for navigation from any external app or a notification to a certain page inside the app.
-> The format for deeplink is like <name>:// and the scheme of the <name> can be defined in the AndroidManifest file in the intent-filters of the Activity class.

-> Anytime the link is clicked, the Android OS checks for the intent filters that support this deeplink.
-> The OS then loads the application(if not opened already) and starts the activity associated.
-> If multiple applications support same deeplink, then an application selector bottom sheet is opened to select the desired app.

-> If the app is not installed then there is some different issue altogether.
-> The link first redirects to the PlayStore. Then PlayStore prompts to install the APK. Then you onboard and use the app.

-> If there is a campaign which is coming as an ad and has a deeplink of the app then following things happen-
    -> if app is installed then page is opened directly

    -> If app is not installed then(Case of Install Referral API)
        -> It goes to PlayStore
        -> PlayStore has Install Referral API that stores this deeplink and stores all params and other info associated iwth it.
        -> Your app is installed and then launched.
        -> During launch, your application can get the required info from this API and can then act accordingly.

    -> If app is not installed(Case of Firebase Dynamic Link)
        -> It connects with play services and Firebase Dynamic Link and stores the information in google servers.
        -> It redirects to play store.
        -> Your app is installed and then launched.
        -> During launch, the app connects with FDL which connects to Google servers for any information wrt this user.

    -> If app is not installed(Case of AppsFlyer)
        -> AppsFlyer is an external SDK that can be a part of your application(if you take its dependency)
        -> Before redirecting to Play Store, it adds this info in its own servers.
        -> App is installed and then launched.
        -> During launch, app connects to appsflyer SDK which connects to its backend which connects to Install Referral API eventually to get info of the deeplink
