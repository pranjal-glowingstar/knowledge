-> ANR stands for Application Not Responding.
-> This happens when the main thread is blocked for more than 5 seconds and is performing non UI operations.
-> This is a very big issue as it makes user experience bad.

-> In order to fix ANRs, we can use strict mode.
-> Strict mode tells us the exact work that the main thread is doing by checking its message queue.
-> We can also print the entire message queue along with all the methods that this thread called during execution.
-> The data gives exact details of the number of methods and the amount for which it was running.
-> Strict mode is only limited to tracking a specific set of problem(like checking a thread, checking a disk, checking a network).

-> We can also check the firebase console for the same. The stack trace does not give a very great idea but can be used for starters.

-> One can also use perfetto Trace to track the entire user journey to track where ANR occurred.
-> Trace also gives similar insights like strict mode.
-> However, this gives some more in depth information about the system and all the thread pools currently working.

-> The industry standard rate for ANRs is 0.47%. So if ANRs are >0.47% then your app is flagged as bad behaviour.
-> less than 0.24% is generally considered good. Many top apps target <= 0.1 % to stay well under the line.
